# Reliance SMART Sales Analytics Dashboard
This project is a detailed Retail Performance Report for Reliance SMART, focusing on analyzing sales, profit, and transaction volume across product brands and geographic regions. The dashboard is designed to provide quick insights into monthly performance relative to goals and to identify high-performing product lines and states.

Key Metrics Tracked:
Revenue vs Previous Month: 120.16K (+5.6%)

Profit vs Previous Month: 71.68K (+5.61%)

Return vs Previous Month: 496 (+11.9%)

# Dataset & Tools Used
Dataset:The analysis uses transactional retail data for Reliance SMART, including fields for product/brand, transactions, quantity sold, revenue, profit, and associated geographical information (States and Regions).

Tools:

Power BI: Employed for data integration, calculation of comparative month-over-month KPIs (Revenue, Profit, Return), and the visualization of geographic and product performance.
# Workflow/Process
The dashboard was structured to enable stakeholders to monitor business health and identify operational successes:

Data Modeling & Quality Check: Sales data was loaded and modeled to link transactional data to product and geographic dimensions.

Comparative DAX Measures: Complex DAX formulas were created to calculate Month-over-Month, variance for Revenue, Profit, and Returns, allowing the business to benchmark current performance against set goals.

Visualization Strategy: The report uses a mix of powerful visuals:

A table provides granular Product Brand Wise Data (Transactions, Qty Sold, Revenue, Profit).

A map visual displays Region Wise Revenue across continents (North America, Asia).

A treemap visualizes State Wise Transactions, clearly showing market concentration.

Interactivity: The use of visual filters is implied, enabling users to drill into specific brands, regions, or time periods.

# Dashboard Insights
The visuals highlight strong growth and key areas of focus:

Growth Trajectory: All three core financial metrics (Revenue, Profit, Returns) show positive month-over-month growth (e.g., Revenue up 5.6%), indicating strong current operational performance.

Product Performance (Granular): The table view shows that brands like "BEST" (5254 transactions) and "BIG CITY" (5797 transactions) are major contributors to overall volume and profit, making them critical product lines.

Geographic Focus: North America and Europe appear to be primary markets for revenue.

Transaction Concentration: The treemap for "State Wise Trans" clearly shows WA (Washington) and CA (California) as the largest markets for transactions, followed by OR (Oregon), highlighting key markets for distribution and logistics planning.

# Results or Conclusion
The dashboard successfully confirms that the business is in a period of positive growth across key financial metrics. The analysis provides actionable data to reinforce successful strategies, primarily by focusing marketing and inventory efforts on the top US states (WA, CA, OR) and ensuring the continued availability of high-performing brands like "BEST" and "BIG CITY".
